Install all required SW:
1. Have Python3 installed (apt-get install python3)
2. Have pipenv installed (pip install pipenv)
3. Have DB created (Kuco's part of work)
4. Have Node.js and NVM installed (apt-get install -y nodejs)
	We must all have the same Node.js version, so please install v13.1.0!!
5. Install Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)

Create new Angular project - we already have created app, just so you know how I did it
	-ng new <app_name>
		- Angular routing - Yes
		- Stylesheet - SCSS

After each pull/before each start of app - run 'npm install' in app folder (it will download and install all needed dependencies)

To compile and start app - type 'npm start'

Generate new component - 'ng g c <name>' (ng generate component)

app.component -> main page
